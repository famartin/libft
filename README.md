# libft
This first project as a student of 42 will make you consolidate your acquired pool. You will recode a number of standard C library functions, as well as other utility functions that you will reuse throughout your curriculum.

# Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

# Technical considerations
* Your libft.h file can contain macros and typedefs if needed.
* A string must ALWAYS end with a ’\0’, even if it is not included in the function’s
description, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
* It is forbidden to use global variables.
* If you need sub-functions to write a complex function, you must define these subfunctions
as static as stipulated in the Norm.
